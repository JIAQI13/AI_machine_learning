This course provides an introduction to reinforcement learning intelligence, which focuses on
the study and design of agents that interact with a complex, uncertain world to achieve a goal.
We will emphasize agents that can make near-optimal decisions in a timely manner with
incomplete information and limited computational resources. The course will cover Markov
decision processes, reinforcement learning, planning, and function approximation (online
supervised learning). The course will take an information-processing approach to the concept of
mind and briefly touch on perspectives from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.
The course will use a recently created MOOC on Reinforcement Learning, created by the
Instructors of this course. Much of the lecture material and assignments will come from the
MOOC. In-class time will be largely spent on discussion and thinking about the material, with
some supplementary lectures.
